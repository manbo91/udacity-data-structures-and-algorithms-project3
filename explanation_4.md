# Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem

## Approach: Sliding Window

We know that 0 is left and 2 is right.
It can be sorted via swap while keeping the last pointer added.

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: `O(n)`.

    index i will iterate n times.

- Space complexity: `O(1)`.

    it takes up space in memory to the call stack.
