# Problem 6: Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: `O(n)`.

    The time-complexity for this program is O(n) because
    we are iterating the elements from input lists(ints).

- Space complexity: `O(1)`.

    The space complexity is O(1) because it only tracks the
    maximum and minimum numbers.
